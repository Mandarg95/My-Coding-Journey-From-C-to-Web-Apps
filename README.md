# My-Coding-Journey-From-C-to-Web-Apps
 This repository contains my mini projects, showcasing my progression from writing simple C programs to developing full-stack web applications. Each project demonstrates different programming concepts, including algorithms, database queries, and web development.
 
Projects Overview

1. Birthdays App (Flask)

A web application that allows users to store and view birthdays in a database.

2. Caesar Cipher (C)

A simple encryption program that implements the Caesar cipher algorithm.

3. DNA Analysis (Python)

A program that analyzes DNA sequences to identify individuals based on genetic markers.

4. Fiftyville (SQL Forensics)

A database-driven mystery-solving project using SQL queries to find a suspect.

5. Filter (C - Image Processing)

A program that applies image filters such as grayscale and blur to BMP images.

6. Finance (Flask, SQL)

A stock-trading web app that allows users to buy and sell stocks, view history, and manage accounts.

7. Homepage (HTML, CSS, JS)

A simple personal website with multiple country-based pages.
